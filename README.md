# ubsCopy (windows)
copy storage devices in a sneaky way ðŸ˜ˆ

first run start.exe ans see how it works

note: if start.exe file didnt work in your pc than you should compile youself as below

windows might block the program and ask your permission, in this case you should allow it

if it sounds suspitious to you, you can compile that main.py and make a exe file, its very straidforward
1) first install python if you havent
2) type "pip install pyinstaller" to the cmd (but before that you need to set python and pip as a environment variable, there are lots of tutorials out there)
3) type "pyinsaller --onefile main.py"
4) you are all set



to use all you need to do is run start.exe, but if dont want a terminal to pop up
then u need to run runScript.vbs and it wont show anything to the user

TIP: if you want to run it automatically you can make a shortcut and move it to the startup path then it would start as the pc boots up

startup path => C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
