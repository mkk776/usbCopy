# ubsCopy (windows)
whenever a storage device is mounted, it automatically detects and starts to copy all the directory

first run start.exe ans see how it works

to use all you need to do is run start.exe, but if dont want a terminal to pop up
then u need to run runScript.vbs and it wont show anything to the user

TIP: if you want to run it automatically you can make a shortcut and move it to the startup path then it would start as the pc boots up

startup path => C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
